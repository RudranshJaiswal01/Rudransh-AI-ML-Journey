# K-Means Clustering from Scratch

This project demonstrates an implementation of **K-Means Clustering** from scratch using Python. The goal is to understand how K-Means works, including centroid initialization, assignment, and optimization.

## 📂 Project Structure

- `K-MeansClustering_scratch.ipynb` - Google Colab notebook implementing K-Means step by step.

## 📚 Concepts Covered

- K-Means Clustering Algorithm
- Cluster Assignment and Centroid Update
- Elbow Method for Optimal K Selection
- Silhouette Score for Evaluating Clustering Performance
- Visualisation of Clustering Results

## 📦 Libraries Used

- **NumPy** - For numerical computations and matrix operations.
- **Matplotlib** - For visualizing clustering results.
- **Pandas** *(if applicable)* - For dataset handling and preprocessing.

## 📜 Usage

You can open and run the notebook directly in **Google Colab** using the following link:

[Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/10crk8YyUr3nVwpMvACmApEdja0fpoMl0?usp=sharing)

**Or**

1. Upload `K-MeansClustering_scratch.ipynb` to your Google Drive and open in Colab.
2. Upload required datasets to the Files section under Files > Upload in Colab.
3. Execute the cells to follow the implementation.

## 📊 Results & Insights

- Implemented K-Means clustering without using external ML libraries.
- Demonstrated the impact of different K values using the Elbow Method.
- Evaluated clustering performance using the Silhouette Score.
- Visualised how clusters form over iterations.

## 🏆 Future Enhancements

- Implementing K-Means++ for better centroid initialisation.
- Optimising performance with vectorised operations.
- Exploring real-world datasets for clustering.
