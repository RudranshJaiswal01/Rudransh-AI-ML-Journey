# Linear Regression from Scratch

This project demonstrates an implementation of **Linear Regression** from scratch using Python. It includes both **simple and multiple linear regression**, built without using machine learning libraries like Scikit-Learn. The goal is to gain a deeper understanding of how linear regression works, including the cost function, gradient descent, and model evaluation.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

- LinearRegression_scratch.ipynb - Google Colab notebook implementing linear regression step by step.
- Datasets/ - Sample datasets used for training and testing.

## ðŸ“š Concepts Covered

- Simple Linear Regression
- Multiple Linear Regression
- Cost Function & Loss Function
- Gradient Descent Optimization
- Feature Scaling & Standardization
- Model Evaluation Metrics

## ðŸ“œ Usage

You can open and run the notebook directly in **Google Colab** using the following link:

1. Click the Colab link above to open the notebook directly

   OR

   Upload LinearRegression\_scratch.ipynb to your Google Drive.

2. Upload required datasets to the **Files** section under **Files > Upload** in Colab.

3. Execute the cells to follow the implementation.

## ðŸ“Š Results & Insights

- Implemented linear regression without external ML libraries.
- Used gradient descent to optimize the model parameters.
- Applied feature scaling to improve performance.
- Visualized the training process and results.

## ðŸš€ Future Enhancements
